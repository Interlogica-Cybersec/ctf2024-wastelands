There's a gas station outside the town, right at the beginning of the desert. It hasn't been completely scavenged yet, it definitely provided shelter for someone a few times, that's for sure. But there's still something useful.

It also houses an SND0, the company used to produce state-of-the-art vending machines,
armored stuff. It still powers up and signals provisions inside, too bad the internal cart and mechanical arm are out of order.
This thing used to connect to the internet, what a dumb idea, maybe we can do something with that Ethernet interface.

Connect to the SND0 and try to open the vending machine door.
