<div style="text-align: justify;">There's a gas station outside the town, right at the beginning of the desert. It hasn't been completely scavenged yet, it definitely provided shelter for someone a few times, that's for sure. But there's still something useful.<br/>
<br/>
It also houses an SND0, the company used to produce state-of-the-art vending machines,<br/>
armored stuff. It still powers up and signals provisions inside, too bad the internal cart and mechanical arm are out of order.<br/>
This thing used to connect to the internet, what a dumb idea, maybe we can do something with that Ethernet interface.<br/>
<br/>
Connect to the SND0 and try to open the vending machine door.</div>
