<div style="text-align: justify;margin-bottom:1rem;">
The door to the ground station's main control room is closed, but we found an old disabled GMS-06 defense droid.
It seems it was being worked on when the bombs fell. There's still a USB key attached to it with a DFSec logo on it.
We managed to read the key: it seems to be some kind of memory dump from the droid.
Maybe we can use it to retrieve the entrance code to the station's control room.
