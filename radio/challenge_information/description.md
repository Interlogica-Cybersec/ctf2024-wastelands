Silence dominates the crumbling city. Our hearts race as we spot a radio tower. "This could be our salvation," we whisper. "Is it a distress signal or something sinister?" We approach cautiously. The generator looks intact. "We must get it running." With a deep breath, we pull the starter cord. The engine roars to life. "Here we go," we mutter, adjusting the radio.
Maybe we'll be able to find someone who owns a vehicle and can help us reach the shipyard.
