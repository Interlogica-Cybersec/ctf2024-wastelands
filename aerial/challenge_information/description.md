The visit to the laboratory proved useful! We just need to activate this tiny reconnaissance drone and make it fly in order to find the location of the ESAP groundstation.
This thing needs a passcode to be activated by the operator.
Maybe we can hack it and find that code!
Oh wow, it has wi-fi and a web interface, who would have thought.
