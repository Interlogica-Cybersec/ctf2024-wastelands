EVERYONE THIS IS A MESSAGE FROM THE SURVIVOR'S HUB OWNER!
A group of marauders came after us forcing the team and I to flee from our base. All are safe and our servers are physically impenetrable and well hidden but we lost remote access to them.
If anyone could retrieve the file "key" from my home directory please reach out to jacob@survivors.hub
