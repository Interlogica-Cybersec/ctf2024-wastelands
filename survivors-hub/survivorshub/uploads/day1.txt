My name is Francis, and I don't even know if anyone will ever read this. The world I knew has been reduced to ashes and radiation. I'm writing this as a desperate plea for help, for anyone who might still be out there.

I've been on the move since the bombs fell, scavenging what little resources I can find amidst the ruins of civilization. It's a bleak and desolate landscape, one that bears no resemblance to the world I once knew. The air is thick with smoke and dust, and the sky is perpetually shrouded in a sickly gray haze.

Today, I stumbled upon an old facility, its walls crumbling and its windows shattered. In my desperation for shelter and supplies, I ventured inside, hoping to find something of value. But what I found instead was a trap, a cruel twist of fate that has left me stranded and alone.

As I explored the facility's labyrinthine corridors, I heard a loud clang behind me, followed by the sound of metal scraping against metal. I turned around to find that the door I had entered through had been sealed shut, leaving me trapped inside with no way out.

Panic surged through me as I frantically searched for another exit, but to no avail. The facility is a maze of dead ends and locked doors, each one mocking my attempts to escape. I'm running out of time, running out of hope.

Food and water are scarce, and I don't know how much longer I can last in this hellish prison. But I refuse to give up, refuse to let despair consume me. That's why I'm writing this, uploading it to the survivor hub in the faint hope that someone, anyone, will come to my rescue.

Please, if you're out there, if anyone is out there, I beg of you: help me.
