Subject: R:Half-Day Leave Request
Hi Brian,
We are compelled to decline your request for leave. 
This marks the sixth medical visit in the past month, all due to your belief that your "friend" is larger than usual. 
Until there is tangible evidence that the situation poses a danger to you or your colleagues, I would suggest we put an end to this.
Best regards,
HR Team
