The entrance door is locked with one of those old electric locks that can only be opened remotely. There's a skeleton right besides the door. Maybe it's of somebody who used to work here: he certainly didn't die yesterday. Or 1 year ago. Or 20. A broken phone lies besides the corpse: the screen is cracked and the electronics are long gone. The SIM card seems relatively fine though, maybe we can still use it to open the door somehow.
